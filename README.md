  - *Matplotlib*: The Grandaddy of all python plotting packages
  - *Gensim*: Framework for vector modeling
  - *NLTK* & *Spacy*: Used for natural language processing
  - *NumPy*: Array processing tool
  - *Scikit-learn*: Modules for machine learning & data modeling
  - *SciPy*: Scientific library for python
  - *Seaborn*: Statistical data visualizer
  - *Pip* & *Setuptools*: package installer & version manager
  - *Sqlite*: Standalone, lightweight SQL database engine
  - *Statsmodels*: Simple statistical computation (used with SciPy)

## OPTIONAL TOOLS 
These tools aren't required, but they offer some additional functionality that you may find helpful in the future!
- **[Atom](https://atom.io)** or **[Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com)** - Popular text editors for writing code
- **[Import.io](https://www.import.io)** - a user-friendly web scraping tool

## A NOTE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY
If you are using a PC (or Linux machine), you may need to [follow some additional steps](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install) to get your environment setup correctly. 

- **Compatibility Issues** - Python and Anacondas have some known issues with Windows 7 x64 machines. If you are running this OS, it is recommended that you [install a virtual machine](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/images) in order to run Anacondas.
